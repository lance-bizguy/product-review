#### This is the first screen of the app.  I want the various electronics categories to appear on the left pane.  Then when I hit one of those I want the sections on the right to show the products for each store.

Under our logo we should see the products from our store and under their logo the corresponding products from their store.

#### When I click a product on the right hand side on the first screen I want it to open a dialog that shows me a breakdown of the product in each store.  Things like proce, customer rating, etc..

I want to see how we stack up with our competitors.
